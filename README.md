## Computing & Society @ Stanford
### Who are we?
 
**Computing & Society** is an interdisciplinary group of Stanford students dedicated to bringing more discussions about the ethical and societal implications of computing and computer science research to the Stanford community. We are graduate students and post doctoral fellows in Computer Science, Cyber Policy, Biomedical Informatics and Management Science and Engineering at Stanford University.

**Reading Group.** We run a weekly reading group where we discuss why the CS community chooses the problems it does, what types of problems and scientific methods are elevated by the present incentive structure, and what our role as individual researchers can be in shifting it towards an approach that engages with social impacts of our work more critically. We realize that the dilemmas we face in our research, while often portrayed as new and unique to Computer Science or "AI", are not unprecedented. During spring quarter 2022, we are reading [Ghost Work](https://ghostwork.info/). Our previous discussion topics and readings can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16wva4Ij_7zt0Ruip0LbUpMGCVJTqruNSZhSvq8iPaPo/edit?usp=sharing).
 
**Advocacy.** Our members are also involved in various advocacy efforts. We are proposing ways the Stanford CS department can center ethics in its teaching and mentoring, funding, and research in an ethics statement for the department. With support from the [McCoy Family Center for Ethics in Society](https://ethicsinsociety.stanford.edu/), we are kicking off a series of Ethics Roundtable Lunchs during summer 2021 to create a judgment-free environment for students to present their research and receive feedback on the ethical implications of their work. We are pushing to include consideration of ethical impacts of research in the criteria for Stanford CS graduate admissions process.
